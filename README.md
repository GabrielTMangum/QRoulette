# QRoulette

The purpose of this project is to stretch and practice my skills in React as well as teach myself Next.js.  The user will be able to visit the site and will be presented with a large QR code that will take them to a new website every time. It's a fun way for me to continue to use the skills I've learned while also learning new ones along the way.  Stay tuned as I continue to make progress on the project.
